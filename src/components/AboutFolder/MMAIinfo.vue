    <h2>MegaMinerAI Info</h2>
    <p>
      MegaMinerAI is a 24-hour artificial intelligence (AI) programming
      competition hosted each semester by ACM-Game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Competitors must use their 24-hours to develop a program to play a novel
      game developed by ACM-Game’s
    </p>
    <p>
      development team. The details of the game are kept secret until the day of
      competition, so competitors must
    </p>
    <p>demonstrate their wits and coding skills to develop the best AI!</p>

    <p>
      Programs are pitted against one another in ACM-Game’s Arena, where
      thousands of games are played in the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Game results are available to users, so that they may further debug their
      code and refine their strategy. After the
    </p>
    <p>
      competition ends, a triple-elimination is run to determine the winners.
      The top three student teams are awarded
    </p>
    <p>prize money and crowned as the victors of MegaMinerAI.</p>
